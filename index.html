        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>  
	  <div>I have grown interest in IT since leaving school and working within the industry. I have noticed the changing roles within an IT department a seeing different aspects of how things work I have begun to become more and more interested in the way in which certain processes happen. The IT experience I currently have obtained over my 3 years working in the industry is a combination of a helpdesk perspective working as a Helpdesk Coordinator and 1st Level support where you are taking the calls from the users and doing basic troubleshooting before passing over to technical staff. Also, more recently getting to experience the technical side being a Desktop Support and Systems Administrator which involves doing the troubleshooting of technical issues and being an escalation point for more junior techs.<br> <br>
          
    I have come to RMIT to get a better understanding of the bigger picture rather than just knowing issues specific to my work environment, and to be able to use skills learnt from my time at RMIT in the future when advancing to different roles within IT. <br> <br>
        
     I expect to learn within this course how to apply my knowledge that I learn during this course and apply it to real world situations for example at work coming up with new ideas about how particular processes can be better managed.<br> <br> </div>

            My ideal job would likely be a Network Engineer type job similar to the above, I do not know much about networking however in my current role whenever some networking issues come up I seem to be intriged by it. I would like to head into the direction of networking not because I know a lot about it but because I want to know more about it.<br><br>
            
            The skills and knowledge required for this role are Network Administration, Firewalls, Fortinet, Switching, Routing and LAN-WAN to name a few. You would also likely need some sort of networking degree aswell to be able to be considered for this role.    
            </p><br>
            Working as a Systems Administrator I do have some basic knowledge of a few of these concepts and how they are implemented such as setting up and configuring switches and some knowledge of DHCP and IP reservations within it. However I would definatly need some sort of networking degree to properly understand this for a role like this.<br><br>

                 <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
                   <p>The Myers-Briggs Test is designed to measure psycological preferences. The two strongest catogories for me were Identity and Tactics. 
In the Identity catogory it shows to me that I am less confident in my own ability and decisions than I am in others due to my high scoring in the “Turbulent” side. This could mean in a team environment that I am more likely to trust the idea of someone else rather than myself. 
In the tactics catogory I scored hign in the “Prospecting” side. This would mean that possibly in a team situation I am more likely to look at something in a positive way rather than looking at the negatives

                   <p>The “Big 5 Test” indicates that I scored high in the Neuroticism category, meaning that I Will often react more to negative emotions such as anxiety, guilt, sadness and shame. I also have a high score in “Agreeableness” showing that I have a tendency to put others above my own in many situations. This could mean that in a team environment I might react better to positive and constructive feedback from peers.

                   <p>Learning Styles Test – the results I got from this test show that I am not an auditory learner but a visual learner. This could mean that I would learn better in situations where I am doing something or someone is doing something in front of me rather than hearing them explain it. This could mean in a team situation a call where we share screen might be better than just hearing someone explain a concept to me

       <article id="Project Idea">
           <h2>Project Idea</h2>
            <p>My Idea for a project is based on mostly how I could make my time for work as a Systems Administrator easier and thus be a tool for technicians in similar role that can help make life easier.
To add to this, in my ideal Job as a Network Engineer this tool would be useful as well showing that in a tech world this would be useful on both a senior level and Junior level.
My Idea is to program a Raspberry pi in a way that it can be used as a network monitoring device and would look something like the below. <br>
                

            </p>
            <p><img src= "./upsalert.jpg"> <br>
                    </p>
           <p> This would help to understand if there was something that was failing within the network and also be able to pin point the time of failure. This can act as another form of troubleshooting on both a junior and senior level. <br> <br>
            
            The way that this would also be setup is to have an alerting system built into it as well. This means that if there was a failure over the weekend or outside of work hours the technician would get a text or e-mail to his or her phone or e-mail. <br><br>   
            
            This would likely succeed in the real world because of that fact it targets such a large group. As of June 2017, there are 2.7 million large businesses in Australia, all of these large businesses would have an IT department and infrastructure that consists of critical servers, UPS’s, Backup servers and more. This monitoring device would be targeted at these large businesses as in these situations with large international corporations for IT to run smoothly becomes more and more important to that staff of these companies as when something fails it affects more and more people.<br><br>
               
            In my current role in the IT industry I understand how easy it can be for alerting systems to fail. The issue with this is there is often no way of knowing if they are failing until the fail occurs and it becomes critical. <br><br>
               
            These critical services would be much better managed in an environment where an alerting system is setup for critical servers and services particularly for a large business that can’t miss a beat. I would like to see this implemented as having worked in the industry for a while now it can sometimes be hard to differentiate the difference of when an alerting system is not properly functioning but being able to go to the device in question and physically see what the status of it is would be a great troubleshooting aspect to have.<br><br>   
               
            The drawbacks and obstacles I can see with this would probably be the physical programming of the Raspberry pi. Having had no experience with Raspberry Pi’s before this could defiantly be a challenge for me. It would take quite a bit of research and testing to get this part right.<br><br>
            
            Another challenge would also be the alerting system, again finding out a way to program this and get it all ready to be alerting to the tech. To figure out a way to setup alerting to the tech through either e-mail or text is something I have not yet done or had experience with but would likely be done with the programming of the Raspberry Pi.<br><br>  
               
            The other items required for this concept would also require a centred online system with details of the servers or services being monitored, an example of this is opmanager. This is an online database that assists with managing and monitoring of these services. This could serve as an alerting system and a location to keep information on what is happing at any point in time.<br><br>   
               
            
            If this project idea were to succeed it would defiantly serve as a solution to the original problem. Techs working in large industry style companies would have another form of checking and troubleshooting issues with their critical services when an issue arises.
